Project for 42Quebec

This project consists of making a wireframe isometric projection of the provided maps with the graphic handler MLX. To make this work, download the Codam MLX that can be found on github and Homebrew 42 (Does not work with the usual homebrew). To install the dependencies, do "make dep".

The maps used have to be rectangular in shape and only include numbers or negative numbers. Does not support color, rotation or other projections.
